# homelab-gitops

Argo CD GitOps repo for the homelab AKS cluster, using the **app-of-apps** pattern.
Argo CD itself is installed by the Terraform stack (`../terraform`); this repo holds
everything it deploys onto the cluster.

## Layout

```
k8s/
├── root-app.yaml            # app-of-apps root; recurse + include scope, prune + selfHeal
├── infrastructure/          # platform pieces (sync-wave -1 .. 2)
│   ├── ingress-nginx.yaml   # Helm; Service type LoadBalancer -> Azure LB
│   ├── cert-manager.yaml    # Helm (jetstack); crds.enabled: true
│   ├── cluster-issuers.yaml # raw ClusterIssuers (Let's Encrypt staging + prod), wave 1
│   └── argocd-server-ingress.yaml # Argo CD UI at argocd.lindrit.at, TLS, wave 2
└── apps/                    # one Application per app (sync-wave 0)
    ├── whoami.yaml          # Application -> apps/whoami/  (https://whoami.lindrit.at)
    └── whoami/              # the app's raw manifests
        ├── deployment.yaml
        ├── service.yaml
        └── ingress.yaml
```

Most files under `infrastructure/` are Argo CD `Application`s. The root re-applies
itself, so the root manages itself. `prune: true` is set everywhere — **deleting a file
from this repo tears down the workload**.

The root recurses the repo but **scopes what it adopts** via
`directory.include: '{root-app.yaml,infrastructure/*,apps/*.yaml}'`. That means it picks
up the top-level files in each area but NOT the per-app manifest folders under
`apps/<name>/` — those are managed by each app's own Application. Without this scope the
root would apply `apps/<name>/*` directly AND the child Application would too, and they'd
fight over the same resources.

`cluster-issuers.yaml` is the exception: it holds raw cert-manager `ClusterIssuer`
resources (not an Application), applied directly by the root at sync-wave `1` so they
land after cert-manager and ingress-nginx are healthy.

### AKS webhook drift / Argo CD selfHeal loop

On AKS, the admission "enforcer" injects extra `namespaceSelector.matchExpressions`
(`control-plane`, `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby`) into **every** webhook config so they
skip system namespaces. cert-manager additionally rewrites the webhook `caBundle`. Neither
is in the Helm-rendered manifest, so Argo CD reads them as permanent drift and — with
`selfHeal` — re-syncs every second. Both `cert-manager.yaml` and `ingress-nginx.yaml`
defuse this with `ignoreDifferences` on the webhook `namespaceSelector.matchExpressions`
(and `caBundle` for cert-manager) plus the `RespectIgnoreDifferences=true` sync option.
Don't remove those — any chart that ships an admission webhook on AKS needs the same.

## Adding a web app (e.g. `whoami`)

App workloads live under `apps/` (sync-wave `0`, so they land after the platform). Each
app is **one Application** (`apps/<name>.yaml`) pointing at a manifests folder
(`apps/<name>/`) that holds its Deployment + Service + Ingress. To expose it on the
internet at `https://<name>.lindrit.at`:

1. Make sure DNS resolves — the wildcard `*.lindrit.at → 20.79.103.132` covers it.
2. `apps/<name>/ingress.yaml`: set `host: <name>.lindrit.at`, `ingressClassName: nginx`,
   annotation `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod`, and a `tls` block with a
   `secretName` — cert-manager issues the cert automatically.
3. `apps/<name>.yaml`: an Application with `CreateNamespace=true` and
   `destination.namespace: <name>`.

`whoami/` is a complete, copyable example.

## Bootstrap (once)

```sh
kubectl apply -f root-app.yaml
```

After that, adding or removing a workload is just a commit:

- **Add** a workload → add an `Application` file under `infrastructure/` (or a new `apps/`).
- **Remove** a workload → delete its file (prune tears it down).

## Conventions

- `infrastructure/` = sync-wave `-1` (ingress, cert-manager, …) so platform pieces land
  before app workloads (`apps/`, sync-wave `0`).
- Helm-backed apps create their own namespace via `CreateNamespace=true`.
- Apps that source from this repo use `repoURL: https://github.com/lindritP/homelab_k8s.git`.

## Before first sync — verify

- **Chart versions** (`targetRevision`) are pinned but should be checked/bumped:
  `helm repo add … && helm search repo <chart> --versions`.
